## FAQ
#### Why the hell the package name is "app"?
Well, forget about Java. It's not something bad and it has good reasons. This is really needed to have fully working Kodebase Templates for Android Studio with all their benefits. Ofcourse you can change it to your own, but then templates wouldn't be 100% seamless.
